Storyform is built to work with mainly HTML5 standard semantic article content. It attempts to remove any inline styling or extraneous elements and simply uses the underlying semantic elements. It then applies it's template layout and styling that you chose for the post. Storyform does not support:

- `<object>` based videos or content
- `<iframe>` embedded elements other than YouTube, Vimeo videos
- links or alignment attributes on embedded media

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Can I get an application key? =

Absolutely, just signup at [https://storyform.co/#signup](https://storyform.co/#signup).

= When I preview my page it shows up blank. What's going on? =

Storyform is still a bit fragile. We are working out the kinks. Start by going to your post's content and ensuring that there aren't any funny elements (`<object>` tags, `<iframe>`s or other interesting elements). Remove them one by one and see if that helps. If not, please contact us at hello at storyform.co
